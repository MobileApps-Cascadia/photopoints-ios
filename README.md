## App Purpose
Encourage users of all ages to help track phenology and health of key biotic or abiotic components of a client-overseen biome.

### Stakeholders
David Bain - Friends of North Creek Forest

### MVP
* Allow contribution tracking by registering an optional account
  - Enable user registration and authentication
  - Gather user email addresses for association with their contributions
* Allow browsing of the entire Photopoint collection
  - Provide pictures and information identical to what is hosted on plantsmap.org
* Enable scanning of Photopoint QR codes
  - Give detail (matching that on PlantsMap) about the plant or feature represented by this Photopoint
  - Unlock the ability to perform a survey, including capturing an image, on that Photopoint
* Allow users to see where all Photopoints are on a map
  - Enable at-a-glance assessment of Photopoints surveyed within a TBD session duration (i.e. same day)
  - Allow users to view Photopoints of critically low geospatial distance from one another in a collection marker
