Beavers use this willow in the construction of their dams.\n\nWillows grow rapidly and quickly provide part-shade. This creates poorer conditions for weeds by over-shading, and better conditions for fish by cooling streams. Willow's roots also grow swiftly which controls soil erosion. This tree is easily grown from cuttings, making a cost effective plant source.\n"

It is valued for its general wildlife cover.\n\nThis hardy shrub is regularly used in restoration especially in areas that are wet for at least part of the year. This plant's rapid growth is useful in control erosion in riparian and other wetland areas. Twinberry can be live staked and used in bio-engineering such as fascines or stabilizing shorelines. This plant is a component used in hedgerows and wind shelters.\n\nTwinberry grows in moist, seasonally wet and flooded areas, typically appearing near streams and coastal areas. Soils vary from silty clay to coarse sand. It can withstand full sun but it is typically found in shady conditions.\n"

They should always be cooked, since the raw berries may cause nausea. They were sometimes boiled to make a sauce or cooked with the stems intact. The stems and seeds were discarded later. The berries make an excellent, tangy jelly and some people make wine from them, but they should always be cooked for this purpose. Caches of red elderberries have been found in archaeological sites dating back hundreds of years.\n\nBirds including  sparrows, thrushes, warbler, bluebirds, jays, tanagers, grosbeaks, sapsuckers, woodpeckers, and band-tailed pigeons eat berries. Nectar eaten by bumblebees and butterflies. Cavity-nesting bees use broken branches as nest sites. Small mammals also eat fruits. Deer and elk consume foliage and twigs.\n"

Black cottonwood is easily live staked and its extensive lateral root system helps to filter and stabilize soil especially on steep slopes.\n\nThey provide food source and cover for a variety of wildlife species, including deer, elk, and beaver. Large birds use the crowns for nesting sites and various animals rely on the trunk cavities, which commonly result from heart rot in most stands nearing maturity. The rotten trunks of black cottonwood provide an important wildlife habitat otherwise scarce, especially of the Cascades.\n\nBlack cottonwood is often found growing in wetlands, stream banks, floodplains and near other wet areas in communities made up of western hemlock, skunk cabbage, Douglas fir, western red cedar and salmonberry.\n"
