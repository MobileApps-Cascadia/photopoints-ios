"The tart, purple berries of both Oregon-grapes were eaten, but generally not in quantity. Often they were mixed with salal or some other sweeter fruit. Today they are used for jelly, and some people make wine from them. An excellent jelly can be made using two cups Oregon-grape juice, two cups salal juice, five cups sugar and one box pectin crystals.

The bark is bright yellow inside, due to an alkaloid, berberine. The shredded bark of the stems and roots was used to make and bright-yellow dye for basket materials. The bark and berries were also used medicinally for liver, gall-bladder and eye problems. One Saanich woman noted that eating the berries in quantity was the only antidote known for shellfish poisoning. Great caution was used, because this drug is very potent"
