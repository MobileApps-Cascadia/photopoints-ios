The white, waxy-looking berries are considered poisonous by aboriginal peoples. They are given names like 'corpse berry' or 'snake's berry' in several languages. One Stl'atl'imx story identifies the berries as the 'saskatoon berries of the people in the Land of the Dead.' However, one or two berries were eaten by the Stl'atl'imx to settle the stomach after too much fatty food" (Pojar and MacKinnon 2004,reproduced with permission).


From USDA:

“Some southern groups made brooms out of the branches and the Gitksan hollowed out the twigs to make pipe-stems. An infusion of the fruit was used as eyewash for sore eyes and the berries were rubbed on the skin as treatment for burns,rashes, and sores. A decoction of the roots and stems was used in the treatment of the inability to urinate, venereal diseases, tuberculosis and the fevers associated with teething sickness.” (Favorite 2003)

Restoration application

Grosbeaks, waxwings, robins,thrushes, towhees, grouse, pheasants, and quails eat the berries when other food sources are scarce. Snowberry is often used as a nesting habitat for gadwall ducks. Snowberry provides nectar that bumblebees and hummingbirds feed on. It also provides low shelter and nesting cover for small animals. (WNPS)
