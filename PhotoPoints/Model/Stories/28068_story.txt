Grosbeaks, waxwings, robins,thrushes, towhees, grouse, pheasants, and quails eat the berries when other food sources are scarce. Snowberry is often used as a nesting habitat for gadwall ducks. Snowberry provides nectar that bumblebees and hummingbirds feed on. It also provides low shelter and nesting cover for small animals.

The snowberry is often found in streams or river banks, riparian corridors, seashores, coastal dunes or beaches, rocky slopes, outcrops, crevices, gullies, open forests, forest edges, openings, or clearings, and thickets.
