"The shiny, black, bitter, twinned berries are not considered edible by most people. They were given names like 'raven's food,' 'crow berry,' and 'monster's food' by northwest coast peoples. There were some taboos against eating them. For example, the Kwakwaka'wakw: believed that eating the berries would cause one to become unable to speak. The bark and twigs were used in a variety of medicinal preparations, ranging from treatments for digestive tract problems to contraceptives. The Quileute and Kwakwaka'wakw peoples used the berries as a black pigment. The Haida rubbed the berries on the scalp to prevent hair from turning grey." (Pojar and MacKinnon 2004). 

From USDA Plant Guide:
The Haida rubbed the berries on the scalp to prevent hair from turning gray (Ibid.). A decoction of the bark has been applied to a woman’s breasts to encourage milk flow (Moerman 1998).  An infusion was used to treat chest and stomach complaints and to cleanse the body (Ibid.).”

Restoration Applications: This hardy shrub is regularly used in restoration especially in areas that are wet for at least part of the year (WNPS). This plant's rapid growth is useful in control erosion in riparian and other wetland areas. Twinberry can be live staked and used in bio-engineering such as fascines or stabilizing shorelines. This plant is a component used in hedgerows and wind shelters (Darris).
Wildlife value: This member of the honeysuckle family attracts pollinators like butterflies, bumble bees, and hummingbirds with its flower. The shiny black berries are eaten by bears, small mammals, and birds such as quail, grouse, songbirds and thrushes. It is valued for its general wildlife cover (Darris).

Associations:
Twinberry grows in moist, seasonally wet and flooded areas, typically appearing near streams and coastal areas. Soils vary from silty clay to coarse sand. It can withstand full sun but it is typically found in shady conditions (Darris).
