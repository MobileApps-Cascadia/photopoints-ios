The bark was boiled and the tea (or syrup) was drunk as a strong laxative by the Nuxalk, Coast Salish, Quileute, Nuu-chah-nulth, Kwakwaka'wakw and other groups. Cascara has been scientifically substantiated as an effective laxative. The hydroxymethylanthraquinones it contains cause peristalsis of the large intestine, with little or no effect on the small intestine at low dosages. The bark was often allowed to age before use because the fresh bark is said to be nauseating. The Coast Salish collected and dried the bark in strips in spring or summer. The following summer it was pounded and steeped in cold water, then boiled. Usually a handful of bark per quart of water was used. This plant was also used as a medicine for washing sores and swellings, and treating heart strain, internal strains and biliousness" (Pojar and MacKinnon 2004).
