"The Nuu-chah-nulth made children's bows and other small items from the wood, and the Cowichan recently have made knitting needles from it. The Nuxalk considered this shrub highly poisonous and, along with the Coast Salish and Kwakwaka'wakw, used a tea made from a stick with the outer bark peeled off as an emetic or purgative. These three groups also used a medicine from ninebark as a laxative. The Nuxalk used medicinal preparations from ninebark for gonorrhea and scrofulous sores on the neck.

This species is called ninebark because it was believed there are nine layers of shreddy bark on the stems. Greek physa ('bellows' or 'bladder') and carpos ('fruit') form the genus name, because of the inflated follicles.
