This species is called ninebark because it was believed there are nine layers of shreddy bark on the stems. Greek physa ('bellows' or 'bladder') and carpos ('fruit') form the genus name, because of the inflated follicles.

Fruits are eaten by birds. Twigs, buds, and foliage are browsed by herbivores.

Pacific Ninebark are commonly found in swales or wet ditches, marshes or swamps, stream or river banks, riparian corridors, open forests, forest edges, openings, or clearings, thickets.
