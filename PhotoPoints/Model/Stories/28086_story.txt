The rapid growth of this tree, which is typical of pioneer species, makes it a great choice for over-shading and crowding out invasive species in wet areas. Black cottonwood is easily live staked and its extensive lateral root system helps to filter and stabilize soil especially on steep slopes.

They provide food source and cover for a variety of wildlife species, including deer, elk, and beaver. Large birds use the crowns for nesting sites and various animals rely on the trunk cavities, which commonly result from heart rot in most stands nearing maturity. The rotten trunks of black cottonwood provide an important wildlife habitat otherwise scarce, especially of the Cascades.

Black cottonwood is often found growing in wetlands, stream banks, floodplains and near other wet areas in communities made up of western hemlock, skunk cabbage, Douglas fir, western red cedar and salmonberry.
