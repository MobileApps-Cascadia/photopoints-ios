"Branches of all species of wild rose - along with skunk cabbage leaves, fern fronds, pine needles, or salal - were sometimes put in steaming pits, cooking baskets and root-storage pits. Cedar-root cooking baskets used for boiling foods often had rose leaves placed under and over food to flavour it and protect it from burning. 

In the spring, the tender young shoots were sometimes eaten. The branches or strips of bark were boiled to make a tea used as an eyewash for cataracts or to enhance eyesight. The Makah mashed the leaves as a poultice for sore eyes and any type of abscess. The chewed leaves were applied to bee stings, and the ripe hips were steeped, mashed and fed to babies with diarrhea. (Pojar and MacKinnon, 2004).
