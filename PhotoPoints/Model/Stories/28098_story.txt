"Red elderberries, though small and seedy, were a highly important food for the peoples of the central and northern coast, although few people sill use them today. They should always be cooked, since the raw berries may cause nausea. They were sometimes boiled to make a sauce or cooked with the stems intact. The stems and seeds were discarded later. The berries make an excellent, tangy jelly and some people make wine from them, but they should always be cooked for this purpose. Caches of red elderberries have been found in archaeological sites dating back hundreds of years. 
The stems, bark, leaves and roots especially in fresh plants, are toxic due to the presence of cyanide-producing glycosides" (Pojar and MacKinnon 2004; reproduced with permission).


Restoration Application:
From USDA:


 "Consider using supplemental irrigation in the low rainfall during establishment year or years of establishment. It resprouts from both roots and the seed bank following fire. Severe pruning will prevent a spindly growth habitat in ornamental application." (Pete Gonzalves and Dale Darris).
