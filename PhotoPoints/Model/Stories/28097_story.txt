Pacific willow contributes to wildlife cover for species such as deer, mice, voles, beavers, and birds. Beavers use this willow in the construction of their dams.

Willows grow rapidly and quickly provide part-shade. This creates poorer conditions for weeds by over-shading, and better conditions for fish by cooling streams. Willow's roots also grow swiftly which controls soil erosion. This tree is easily grown from cuttings, making a cost effective plant source.
