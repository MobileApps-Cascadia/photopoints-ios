"The Straits Salish and the Halq'emeylem peeled the bark of [native willow species] in May or June, removed the outer part, split the inner tissue into thin strands, and twisted these into long ropes. This rope was used to make fishing lines and various types of nets, including gill-nets, reef-nets, purse-nets, bag-nets, and duck-nets.

“Inner bark was dried, ground into a powder, and then added to flour for making bread. The stems and bark were used in basket making (Moerman 1998). The native Americans used the stems for bow making and the bark for fabric making and tea.” (USDA Plant guide).

Medicinal: Willows produce salicin, which is closely related to acetylsalicyclic acid, commonly known as aspirin. Various preparations from willows are used to treat stomachache, sore throats, colds, diarrhea, and dandruff. The inner bark is haemostatic and has been applied externally to bleeding cuts (Moerman 1998)


Restoration application: Willows grow rapidly and quickly provide part-shade. This creates poorer conditions for weeds by over-shading, and better conditions for fish by cooling streams. Willow's roots also grow swiftly which controls soil erosion. This tree is easily grown from cuttings, making a cost effective plant source. (Fryer).

Wildlife value: Pacific willow contributes to wildlife cover for species such as deer, mice, voles, beavers, and birds. Beavers use this willow in the construction of their dams (Fryer)


Associations: "Despite having preference for damp soils, succeeds in most soils and is often found in riverbanks, floodplains, lakeshores, and wet meadows often standing in quiet river backwaters" (Pojar).
