Paper birch was used much more commonly by interior groups. The bark, which can be peeled off the tree in large, flexible, waterproof sheets, was as important to the native peoples inland from the Northwest Coast as the western redcedar was to the coastal peoples. Baskets and canoes were the most common items constructed from paper birch. The wood was also used as duel, and the sap and inner bark as emergency food. 

Paper birch thrives on burned-over and cut-over areas where it often forms pure stands, though it is later restricted to openings as the forest matures. It readily sprouts from cut stumps. 

A Swedish archaeologist found what could the world's oldest second-hand chewing gum: 9,000-year-old wads of chewed birch resin on the floor of a hut used by Stone-Age hunter-gatherers.  The gum could have been medicinal: birch resin contains zylitol, a disinfectant now sold by the Finns as a natural tooth cleaner. But birch resin also contains terpenes, which could have provided a buzz; Athabaskan Indians were reported to chew birch gum much as Andean people chew coca leaves.In the Ukraine, sap from birches is used to produce a variety of beverages including wine, soft drinks and health tonics. In Alaska, parts of Canada and the northern conterminous U.S., birch is tapped and the sap is used to produce syrup, and homemade wine and beer. 

The name 'birch' is derived from words in many languages, all of which mean either 'a tree whose bark is used fr writing upon' or simply 'bark.' Hence, birch is the 'bark-tree.' The word 'bark' can mean either 'tree-rind' or 'vessel,' the latter reflecting its long-standing use for making canoes or water containers. Betula means 'pitch' because bitumen was distilled from bark (broken clay pots were glued together with birch-bark tar in Roman Britain); papyrifera means 'paper-bearing'
