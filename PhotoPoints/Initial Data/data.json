        "description": "\"Douglas-fir wood and bark was thought by most of the coastal groups to be an excellent fuel, but it had the reputation of throwing sparks and giving splinters to those handling it. The wood was also used to make items such as spear handles, harpoon shafts, spoons, dip-net poles, harpoon barbs, fire tongs, salmon weirs, caskets and halibut and cod hooks. Its pitch was used for sealing joints of implements such as harpoon heads, gaffs and fishhooks, and for caulking canoes and water vessels. The pitch, like that of many coniferous trees, was used to make a medicinal salve for wounds and skin irritations.
