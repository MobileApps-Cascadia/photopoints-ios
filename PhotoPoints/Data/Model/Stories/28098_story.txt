Red elderberries, though small and seedy, were a highly important food for the peoples of the central and northern coast, although few people sill use them today. They should always be cooked, since the raw berries may cause nausea. They were sometimes boiled to make a sauce or cooked with the stems intact. The stems and seeds were discarded later. The berries make an excellent, tangy jelly and some people make wine from them, but they should always be cooked for this purpose. Caches of red elderberries have been found in archaeological sites dating back hundreds of years.

Birds including  sparrows, thrushes, warbler, bluebirds, jays, tanagers, grosbeaks, sapsuckers, woodpeckers, and band-tailed pigeons eat berries. Nectar eaten by bumblebees and butterflies. Cavity-nesting bees use broken branches as nest sites. Small mammals also eat fruits. Deer and elk consume foliage and twigs.
